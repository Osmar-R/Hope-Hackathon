# Hope-Hackathon
COVIDTESTING101 is an application that assists the public in finding COVID-19 testing sites in the U.S, we developed a testing site locator dashboard. Residents can enter their State to find the nearest testing sites as well as additional information. The dashboard will continually be edited as more testing sites and information is available. COVIDTESTING101 can be viewed on all devices such as desktop, tablet, and phones. This is due to the fact that it would allow our user to access this information from any device.
